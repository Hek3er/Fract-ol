## What is a fractals?
Fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which pattern
remains the same at every scale.

we can find some fractal examples in nature, like tree branches.

we can see that the patern remains quiet the same even tho we zoomed in.

In math there is a lot of fractals, Mandelbrot for example is the most famous.

We can generate it from the recursive call of this function:

### ``` Zn+1 = Zn + c //Z(0) = 0```

Z and C are [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number). 

## To run the program:

### For the mandatory part:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hek3er/Fract-ol.git
cd Fract-ol && make
```

```
To use type: ./fractol [FRACTAL]
Mandelbrot: ./fractal mandelbrot
Julia: ./fractol julia [r] [i]

Press:
[+]: To increase iterations
[-]: To decrease iterarions
[SCROLL_UP]: To zoom in
[SCROLL_DOWN]: To zoom out
```
### For Bonus Part:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hek3er/Fract-ol.git
cd Fract-ol && make bonus
```

```
To use type: ./fractol_bonus [FRACTAL]
Mandelbrot: ./fractal_bonus mandelbrot
Julia: ./fractol_bonus julia [r] [i]
Burningship: ./fractal_bonus burningship

Press:
[C]: To change the color
[+]: To increase iterations
[-]: To decrease iterarions
[SCROLL_UP]: To zoom in
[SCROLL_DOWN]: To zoom out
[← ↕ →]: To move the fractal
```
**In this part The zoom follows the mouse position.**
